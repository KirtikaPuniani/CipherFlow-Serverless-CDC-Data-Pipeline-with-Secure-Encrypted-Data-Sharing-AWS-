# 🔐 CipherFlow                               

### Serverless CDC Data Pipeline with Secure Encrypted Data Sharing on AWS

CipherFlow is a **cloud-native, serverless Change Data Capture (CDC) pipeline** that processes incremental database changes and securely distributes **encrypted data snapshots** to external consumers via Amazon S3.

The system is built with **enterprise-grade security**, enforcing strict **producer–consumer isolation** using **AWS KMS asymmetric envelope encryption** — allowing the pipeline to encrypt data **without any ability to decrypt it**.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Traditional batch pipelines:

- Reprocess entire tables weekly
- Increase compute and storage costs
- Lack secure mechanisms for sharing data externally
- Expose risks through shared encryption keys

---

## ✅ CipherFlow Solution

CipherFlow addresses these problems using:

- CDC-based incremental data processing
- Serverless event-driven architecture
- Envelope encryption with asymmetric KMS keys
- IAM-enforced separation of duties

## 🔄 Pipeline Flow

1. **AWS DMS** captures INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE events from the source PostgreSQL database.
2. **AWS Lambda** applies idempotent delta + merge logic to maintain the latest dataset.
3. Lambda generates a **one-time AES data key** to encrypt the CSV snapshot.
4. The data key is encrypted using the **client’s KMS public key**.
5. Encrypted CSV and encrypted data key are uploaded to S3.
6. Client IAM role uses **KMS private key access** to decrypt and consume the file.

## 🔐 Security Design (Key Highlights)

|      Pipeline Role    |        Client Role         |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| `kms:Encrypt` only    | `kms:Decrypt` only         |
| Cannot read data      | Can decrypt data           |
| No private key access | Private key access via KMS |

_> This ensures encryption without decryption capability for the pipeline._

### Why Not Fernet or PGP?

- **Fernet** → Symmetric key, violates separation of duties
- **PGP** → Manual key management, poor IAM/audit integration
- **AWS KMS** → HSM-backed keys, IAM control, audit logs, automated rotation
